  <section aria-labelledby="visitHeading">
    <h2 id="visitHeading">Visit our Experience Center!</h2>
    <p>For many organists, it's a boyhood dream: playing famous pipe organs at home! Since the introduction of <strong>Hauptwerk™</strong>, this dream has come a step closer. Play Hauptwerk™ and Sweelinq organs yourself in our <strong>Experience Center</strong> in Ermelo on the Veluwe. Here, we'll explain what you can expect from our Experience Center.</p>
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="centerFeaturesHeading">
    <h2 id="centerFeaturesHeading">Our Experience Center</h2>
    <p>In Ermelo, in addition to various standard Cambiare organs, you will also find an organ in an extensive (extended) configuration. This applies to both the exterior (various options and possibilities), the interior (high-capacity PC, high-quality components), and the audio (multi-channel audio with advanced front/rear setup).</p>
    <p>The Hauptwerk™ and Sweelinq organs in our Experience Center are set up and ready to play in various configurations.</p>
    <p>The Experience Center offers the opportunity to play the organs in peace or to ask questions to product specialists who provide small demonstrations on any desired organ and organ style. Experience the unmatched sounds of famous pipe organs, now closer than ever!</p>
  </section>

  <section aria-labelledby="soundsExperienceHeading">
    <h2 id="soundsExperienceHeading">Sounds and Experience</h2>
    <p>At Content, we understand that listening to an organ is all about experiencing the tonal colors in a specific space. Content Organs firmly believes that only the very best <strong>high-end audio systems</strong> are capable of faithfully reproducing the sampled organ sounds. To achieve this, we have developed our proprietary audio protocol. The distinctiveness of our audio solutions is attributed to the use of fully matched and highly premium components developed by specialists.</p>
    <p>An advanced audio configuration allows you not only to experience sound in two dimensions but even in a 3D surround setup. This means you will perceive the organ sounds not just from the front and/or rear but in an additional dimension that enhances the spatial representation of the (church) space. This allows you to fully immerse yourself in the grandeur and majesty of the organ sounds. Your Cambiare will then sound as a real pipe organ should.</p>
    <p>Samplesets can be finely tuned in your space (Room Correction) to achieve the optimal spatial representation. Even with samplesets featuring extensive natural reverberation, you will hear every detail of the organ. Close your eyes and immerse yourself in the ambiance and atmosphere of the church space of your choice. Play and experience!</p>
