  <ol>
    <li>What is Sweelinq exactly?</li>
    <li>What do you need to play Sweelinq?</li>
    <li>What is the difference between a digital organ and a Sweelinq organ?</li>

    <h2 id="playingHeading">Playing world-famous pipe organs yourself...</h2>
    <p><strong>Sweelinq</strong> (a product of Orgelmakerij Noorlander) is a virtual organ sampler software package. They, just like Hauptwerk, make recordings of world-famous pipe organs. The biggest difference is the payment method, as Sweelinq uses a subscription model. Hauptwerk offers individual sample sets for which you pay a fixed price per sample set.</p>
    <p>After the recordings are made, they are combined to create a sample set. A sample set is a collection of recordings (samples) of a specific organ. This sample set has an extension that allows these sounds to be played through the Sweelinq software package. The aforementioned recording process requires a significant amount of time and effort, but thanks to this investment, organists worldwide can play famous and lesser-known pipe organs in their own living rooms.</p>
    <p>With the Content Cambiare series, Content makes it possible to play Sweelinq. These organs provide an optimal sound experience, easy operation, and reliable quality.</p>

    <h2 id="requirementsHeading">Essential elements to fully experience the Sweelinq sample sets!</h2>

    <article class="subsection" id="computer">
      <h3>1. First and foremost, a computer is required.</h3>
      <p>A Sweelinq sample set consists of a combination of numerous recordings. Per pipe, per register (combination), and at various locations within the space. When you activate a register and press a key, many actions are sent simultaneously. This naturally increases when you play with multiple registers or in polyphony. Only a powerful computer can handle this 'communication' smoothly and without interruptions. At Content Organs, we exclusively use the most powerful (Octa-Core) computers, and our colleagues stay continuously updated on the latest developments in the field of computing.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="subsection" id="console">
      <h3>2. A reliable, durable, and sturdy organ console is essential for years of playing enjoyment.</h3>
      <p>In addition to the software, sample set, and powerful computer, an organ console is, of course, required. This can range from a simple 'console' setup to a beautifully designed organ. The desired arrangement and composition depend entirely on your personal preferences.</p>
      <p>It is important that the components used in constructing your organ are of high quality. The selection of manuals and their 'touch,' the adjustment of the pedal, the use of woodwork for the organ console, and other essential elements are all important. After all, a Hauptwerk organ console can serve as the foundation for your playing enjoyment for more than 25 years, even after updates to sample sets or computers. Content Organs collaborates with reliable partners in constructing its organ consoles. All organ consoles are assembled and built by a Dutch furniture maker. Additionally, we build our organs in accordance with the standard BDO or AGO norms. Truly reliable!</p>

    <article class="subsection" id="operation">
      <h3>3. Operating your Sweelinq organ via touchscreen or stops.</h3>
      <p>In addition to selecting software, a computer, and the right organ console, considering the most suitable method of operation is also important. After all, the Hauptwerk software on the computer needs to be operated. This can be done through large touchscreens, physical stops, or a combination of both.</p>
      <p>When selecting touchscreens, it is crucial that they have very high sensitivity, as you want to be able to register quickly during the excitement of playing the organ. Content Organs uses high-quality touchscreens, which are also used in the automotive industry. Safety is paramount there, requiring a very high sensitivity rate.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="subsection" id="audio">
      <h3>4. Last but not least: for the proper sound experience, a good audio system is invaluable.</h3>
      <p>When experiencing a pipe organ sample set, the quality of playback is, of course, essential. It is unfortunate to spend money on a sample set that cannot be properly reproduced.</p>
      <p>A good audio system includes the correct amplification settings, a high-quality sound card, and high-quality (passive) speakers.</p>
      <p>Content Organs also employs its own audio protocol, in which the conversion of digital recordings (software) into analog audible sounds occurs without any loss of quality. This means we apply strict selection criteria for audio materials and develop as much as possible in-house.</p>
      <p>For example, Content uses its own amplifiers in its Cambiare organs, combined with an innovatively designed passive HQ audio system. Only the best is good enough.</p>

  <section id="digital-vs-sweelinq" aria-labelledby="differenceHeading">
    <h2 id="differenceHeading">Various differences and similarities</h2>
  
    <h3>Digital Organ or Sweelinq Organ?</h3>
    <p><strong>First of all, at Content, you can find both types of organs!</strong></p>
    <p>With our extensive experience (since 1980), we possess in-depth knowledge of pipe organs, audio systems, amplification, and optimal sound reproduction. Both solutions are of high quality.</p>
    <p>One significant difference lies in the way the sound is generated. With a Sweelinq organ, you play pre-recorded samples made in the respective churches. These recordings have been captured at various locations within the church in more recent sample sets.</p>
    <p>It’s also possible to customize the playback position yourself. This way, you’ll hear the organ exactly as it sounds in the chosen church space. This brings a famous church to life in your living room. Listen to our samples for an impression!</p>
    <p>In the case of a digital organ, pre-recorded samples from various churches are combined to create four different organ styles (North German Baroque, Dutch Romantic, French Romantic, and English Symphonic soundscapes). Each organ style has its sample library with so-called 'clean source samples' from which a selection is made when creating the dispositions of a digital organ.</p>
    <p>These 'clean samples' are recordings that faithfully reproduce the pipe organ sound as purely as possible, without spatial effects. Together, an ensemble of samples is created, representing the respective organ style. As an organist, you have control over how these samples are heard in the church space. For example, you can determine the position within the church, add or remove reverb, adjust tunings, add tremolos, and apply various other digital adjustments to the existing source sample.</p>
    <p>This way, you play an organ that is entirely customized and fine-tuned according to your preferences in your living room!</p>
    <p>It’s clear that personal preferences and tastes play a significant role in choosing between a Sweelinq or digital organ. For both solutions, Content Orgels is always your right partner. We're here to offer our guidance!</p>
